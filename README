Python library to deal with Wii formats.

Currently has decent support for discs, partitions (including
accessing the partition data using read() and write(), with
caching), wads, and the structures contained within (certs,
tiks, tmds, etc)

Stuff may be broken. Some things are unfinished.

It also makes breakfast.
